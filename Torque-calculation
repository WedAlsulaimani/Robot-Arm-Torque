Robot arm torque calculation:

weight = 2kg
arm length = 0.4m
joints = 3
position = Horizontal
gears = 5:1 reduction 

The arm is evenly divided = ~0.133m



Torque without gear reduction

First joint:    T = 2 x 9.81 x 0.133             = 2.61 N\cdotpm
Second joint:   T = 2 x 9.81 x (0.133 + 0.133)   = 5.22 N\cdotpm
Third joint:    T = 2 x 9.81 x 0.4               = 7.83 N\cdotpm



Torque after gear reduction (5:1)

First joint =  0.52 Nm
Second joint = 1.04 Nm
Third joint =  1.57 Nm



       Motor Suggestions:

First joint => MG996R , Max torque => ~1.1 Nm 
Second joint => MG996R + Gearbox , Max torque => ~1.1 Nm 
Third joint => JGB37-520 w/ Gearbox , Max torque => ~2 Nm 




Downsides of Doubling Payload (1 kg ‚ûù 2 kg):

*Increased torque demand
*Higher power draw
*More heat on motors
*Slower motion
*Risk of mechanical failure


Solutions:
*Use higher gear ratios
*Choose stronger motors (e.g., Dynamixel, NEMA + gearbox)
*Lighten arm structure
*Add counterweights or spring assistance
